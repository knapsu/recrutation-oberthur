# Recrutation assignment for Oberthur Technologies

tasks done:
- Dockerized Jenkins CI with a job that builds Pet Clinic (job configuration not commited to the repo)
- Docker image for Tomcat application server
- Bundled Pet Clinic with Tomcat as Docker image (needed to patch data-access.properties to work)
- Docker image for Nginx web server
- Docker Compose config for sample target environment

Additionally I've signed SSL certificates and used them with Nginx.
